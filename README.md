# About
## Project OvervieW
The Calculator project is a user-friendly web-based calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It features a clean and modern interface, with options to switch between light and dark modes for better user experience and accessibility. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a lightweight and efficient tool for everyday calculations.

##Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear (CLR) and Delete (DEL) Functions: Users can clear the entire input or delete the last character entered.
Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Light and Dark Mode Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark themes for better visibility and user comfort.

##Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple, yet functional calculator that can be used by anyone for basic mathematical operations. It serves as a practical example of how to build interactive web applications using fundamental web technologies. The project also aims to provide a foundation for further enhancements and customization, allowing developers to add more advanced features and improve the user interface.

##Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the basic structure of the calculator.
CSS: Styles the calculator and handles the light and dark mode themes.
JavaScript: Implements the calculator's functionality and the theme toggle feature.

##How It Works
HTML: The structure of the calculator is defined in the index.html file, which includes the display area, buttons for digits and operations, and the toggle icons for light and dark modes.
CSS: The style.css file contains styles for different elements, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes. It also defines the color schemes for light and dark modes.
JavaScript: The script.js file contains event listeners for button clicks and theme toggles. It handles the logic for performing calculations, updating the display, and switching between themes.
Future Enhancements
While the current version of the Calculator project provides essential features for basic arithmetic operations, there are several potential enhancements that could be implemented in the future:

Scientific Calculator Functions: Adding more advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, and exponents.
History Log: Implementing a feature to keep track of previous calculations.
Memory Functions: Including memory storage and recall capabilities.
Improved UI/UX: Enhancing the user interface for a more intuitive and visually appealing experience.

##Conclusion
The Calculator project is a straightforward and effective tool for basic calculations, demonstrating the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in building interactive web applications. It offers a solid foundation for further development and customization, making it a valuable project for both beginners and experienced developers.
